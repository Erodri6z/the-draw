        <h3>What are Tarot cards</h3>
        <p>Tarot cards are a deck of symbolic cards used for divination, self-reflection, spiritual insight, or even creative storytelling. Though often seen as mystical or magical, they’re really a tool — like a mirror — that helps people explore their inner thoughts, questions, and possibilities.</p>

        <h3>Explaination</h3>
        <p>When you draw three tarot cards completely at random, you're doing more than pulling symbols from a deck — you're opening a quiet space for the universe to speak directly to you.
        <br />
        In that moment, something subtle and sacred happens: you surrender control. You let go of logic, planning, or trying to “figure it all out.” And by doing that, you invite in a message that isn’t filtered by doubt or second-guessing. It’s raw. It's honest. And it’s meant for you.
        <br />
        The cards that appear might seem random — but they’re not. Tarot speaks in symbols, archetypes, and emotion. These images and energies resonate with your subconscious and reflect the deeper truths moving beneath the surface of your life.
        A three-card draw is often simple in form but profound in meaning.

        <h4>Each Position Can Show:</h4>
        <li>Where you've been (Past),</li>
        <li>Where you are (Present),</li>
        <li>And what may come (Future).</li>
        <h4>Or it may show:</h4>
        <li>Your Mind</li>
        <li>Your Heart</li>
        <li>Your Path Forward</li>

        <p>There's no single rule, just an invitation to listen, reflect and feel</p>
        <p>You're not summoning magic from outside yourself, You're revealing what is already inside you, just waiting to be seen. So when you are getting your reading, take a breath and let the cards speak.Trust that what ever came up, was always ment to.</p>

        <h4>Best Practice:</h4>
        <p>Here with The Draw team, while we encourage users to try to get a reading when ever they feel they need a moment to reflect, we encourage moderation due to the fact that trying to force anwsers you want to hear will only confuse and close the line of communication between you and the universe.</p>
